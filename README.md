# ESP32-S3 LVGL Slide Demo (v9)

This project is an ESP-IDF + LVGL demo for the Waveshare ESP32-S3 AMOLED 1.75 board.
It mounts an SD card, loads PNG slide images at runtime, and switches slides with touch gestures.

## Architecture Overview

The project is organized as a small layered application:

1. Platform layer (BSP and board drivers)
- Board init and display bring-up are handled by the Waveshare BSP component.
- SD card is mounted over SDSPI.

2. Runtime services
- LVGL image decoder is initialized via `esp_lv_decoder`.
- Filesystem path for UI assets is mapped to `A:/sdcard` (LVGL path style).

3. UI / feature layer (`slide_player`)
- Creates the LVGL screen and widgets.
- Handles gesture events (left/right swipe).
- Builds image paths like `A:/sdcard/1.png` ... `A:/sdcard/32.png`.

## Runtime Flow

1. `app_main()` starts board display and acquires the display lock.
2. `slide_player_runtime_init()` mounts SD card and initializes LVGL decoder.
3. `slide_player_ui_init()` builds the UI and displays the first slide.
4. Gesture callback updates slide index and refreshes image source.

```

The `lvgl/*` applications are tracked as git submodules; clone with
`git clone --recurse-submodules`, or after cloning run
`git submodule update --init --recursive`.

## Key Dependencies

- ESP-IDF: `5.5.4`
- LVGL: `9.4.x`
- Waveshare board support: `waveshare/esp32_s3_touch_amoled_1_75`
- LVGL decoder: `espressif/esp_lv_decoder`

See `main/idf_component.yml` and `dependencies.lock` for exact dependency definitions.

## Build and Flash

A build is defined by two independent selections: the **board** (hardware) and the
**LVGL project** (application). Use the two-stage selector:

```bash
./switch_board.sh
#   Step 1/2 - Select board          (shows current, '=>' marks it)
#   Step 2/2 - Select lvgl project   (shows current)
#   Enter = keep current, q = quit
```

It writes `./.board` and `./.lvgl_project`, then prints the ready-to-run commands:

```bash
idf.py -DBOARD=amoled_175 -DLVGL_PROJECT=slide_player -B build/amoled_175_slide_player build
idf.py -B build/amoled_175_slide_player -p <PORT> flash monitor
```

Each board+project pair uses its own build directory so configs never mix.

## Multi-board / Multi-app Support

Both `BOARD` and `LVGL_PROJECT` resolve in the same priority order:
`-D<VAR>=<name>` -> environment variable -> persisted file (`./.board` /
`./.lvgl_project`) -> default (`amoled_175` / `slide_player`).

| Board id | Hardware |
|----------|----------|
| `amoled_175` | Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch AMOLED 1.75" |
| `amoled_206` | Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch AMOLED 2.06" |

| LVGL project | App | Recommended board |
|--------------|-----|-------------------|
| `slide_player` | PNG slideshow (gestures) | `amoled_175` |
| `acc_data` | Accelerometer logger (IMU + PMU) | `amoled_206` |
| `battery_monitor` | Battery / PMU monitor (AXP2101) | `amoled_206` |

Each board is self-contained under `boards/<board>/`:

```text
boards/<board>/
|-- CMakeLists.txt      # board component (carries managed deps)
|-- idf_component.yml   # board-specific managed dependencies
|-- board_config.h      # capability flags + pin map
|-- sdkconfig.board     # board sdkconfig overrides (flash size, partition file)
`-- partitions.csv      # board partition table
```

The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` reads `BOARD` (wires `EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`,
per-board `SDKCONFIG` and layered `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS`) and `LVGL_PROJECT`.
`main/CMakeLists.txt` picks the entry file (`app_<project>.c`) and application
sources from `lvgl/<project>/`.


## Slide Asset Requirements

- Place slide images on SD card under `/sdcard`.
- Current code expects numbered PNG files: `1.png` ... `32.png`.
- Gesture behavior:
  - Swipe left: next slide
  - Swipe right: previous slide

## Current Design Notes

- UI updates are gesture-driven and run on LVGL event callbacks.
- Performance logs are emitted on each slide switch to help profile decode and memory usage.
- Asset C files in `slide_player/assets/*.c` are not compiled by default in the current CMake setup; runtime loading is PNG-from-SD based.

## Future Improvement Ideas

- Add rollback cleanup if any runtime init step fails.
- Replace hardcoded slide count with SD directory scan.
- Move machine-specific `.vscode` settings to user-local config.
- Reduce global warning suppression and scope it to specific files only.
