# Slide Player App

Displays 32 numbered PNG slides from the SD card and changes slides with
horizontal touch gestures. Slides must be available as `/sdcard/1.png` through
`/sdcard/32.png`.

## Required Capabilities

The app requires a display, touch input, and SD storage. Compatibility is
declared by each board's `supported_apps.txt`; `board_config.h` provides a
second compile-time capability check. SD wiring and mounting are owned by the
selected board BSP.

`app_slide_player` is an independent selected component. Its app-only image
dependency is `espressif/esp_lv_decoder` 0.4.x.

## Initialization

Initialization starts the BSP display, mounts the SD card, initializes the LVGL
PNG decoder, creates the one-entry request queue and SD reader task, then creates
the UI while holding the BSP display lock. A required failure stops later stages
and rolls back the task, queue, decoder, and SD mount as applicable.

## Task Model

| Task | Stack | Priority | Responsibility |
|:-----|:------|:---------|:---------------|
| `slide_sd_reader` | 4096 bytes | 4 | Validate the latest requested slide file and post a typed result to the LVGL model |

The BSP owns the LVGL task. A one-entry overwrite queue coalesces rapid gestures
so stale slide requests do not accumulate. The UI also drops stale results by
request ID.

## LVGL Model Contract

`slide_player.h` defines the typed bridge. The UI calls the app-provided
`request_slide` callback with a slide index and request ID. The reader task posts
`slide_player_load_result_t` through `slide_player_post_load_result()`; an LVGL
timer consumes that queue and is the only asynchronous path that mutates image
or label widgets.

The top-level frame reads the active display resolution and has no BSP header or
board-specific panel dimensions.

## Device Checks

Builds validate component wiring only. On each board, verify SD mount behavior,
PNG decoding, left/right gestures, boundary handling, rapid gesture coalescing,
missing-file recovery, and full-screen layout.
